# cvProjects
This repository contains the projects I have worked on during my Computer Vision journey. The projects are implemented using OpenCV, PyTorch, and TensorFlow. The projects are divided into two categories: Image Processing and Computer Vision. The Image Processing projects are basic projects that involve image manipulation, while the Computer Vision projects are more advanced projects that involve object detection, image segmentation, and image classification.

## Requirements
All the libraries required to run the projects are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. You can install the required libraries using the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
